    <strong>Pipelines</strong> & <strong>Services</strong> try to abstract the same behaviour as when working with the docker-compose commandline. A <em>Pipeline</em> 
    ideally represents a docker-compose project, and each <em>Service</em> represents a set of containers executed within. Both Pipelines & Services have <em>statuses</em>. 
    Statuses define the current point in the lifecycle of both. Some of those statuses are shared accross both concepts. When clicking on UP in a Pipeline, that will 
    start both the pipeline & the services inside it. The same happens for STOP, or DOWN buttons. Services(containers) can also be started separately, without starting 
    the whole Pipeline.

    Pipeline:
      <ul style="padding-left: 15px;">
        <li><strong>starting:</strong> the pipeline is being started, this state can be reached either from a newly created pipeline or an already created one.</li>
        <li><strong>started:</strong> the pipeline has finished starting. This state is reached from an already created pipeline.</li>
        <li><strong>up:</strong> the same as started, the pipeline has finished starting. This state is reached when creating a new pipeline, or clicking UP from a stopped one.</li>
        <li><strong>stopping:</strong> the pipeline has been commanded to stop, either by clicking on <strong>STOP</strong> or <strong>DOWN</strong> buttons.</li>
        <li><strong>stopped:</strong> the pipeline is stopped. Volumes and containers are preserved.</li>
        <li><strong>down:</strong> the pipeline is stopped, containers are destroyed and all volumes are removed.</li> 
      </ul>

    Service:
      <ul style="padding-left: 15px;">
        <li><strong>starting:</strong> the service is being started. This state can be reached either from a newly created container or an already existing one.</li>
        <li><strong>started:</strong> the service has finished starting. This state is reached from an already created container.</li>
        <li><strong>up:</strong> the same as started, the service has finished starting. This state is reached when creating a new container, or clicking UP from a stopped one.</li>
        <li><strong>stopping:</strong> the service has been commanded to stop.</li>
        <li><strong>stopped:</strong> the service is stopped. Volumes and containers are preserved.</li>
        <li><strong>scaling:</strong> the service has received a scaling request, either to increase or decrease the number of containers running in the docker swarm.</li>
